General directions on the challenge statement can be found in the challenge .pdf file. Follow below for extra relevant information.

## Installing Bloqade and other packages 

All work for this challenge will be based on Bloqade, QuEra's neutral atom emulator and SDK, and - if you feel insispired for something a bit more advanced - on Kirin, our compiler development infrastructure.

Installation instructions for Bloqade and all sub-packages necessary can be found here [here](https://bloqade.quera.com/latest/), and amount to little more than `pip install bloqade`. 

### Pre-made environment on qBraid

If you don't want to worry about setting up your own environment or are having trouble with versions of other installed packages, you can access all you need to participate in this challenge at qBraid's lab notebook. Create an account on [qBraid](https://www.qbraid.com/) and click the button below to launch a pre-made notebook on an environment with everything set to go!


## Documentation

This yearâ€™s ETH Quantum Hackathon challenges require a _notebook_ implementation that is heavily considered during judging, as well as generating a small slide presentation to explain your experience and development to the judges. Your notebook with all circuit solutions should be executable. Bug reports will also count points, but only if you submit them via a Github issue at [Bloqade's Github repo](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/bloqade-circuit)!

### Submissions and pre-submissions

For solution submissions should follow guidelines from Dorahacks and the hackathon organizers!

### Evaluation criteria
